# Initial Rails (Edge) Application Setup

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Date**: November 2025  
**Labels**: agent:devtooling, priority:high

---

## Goal

Create the initial **Rails (edge)** monolith in repo root, configured with **PostgreSQL**, **Solid Queue**, **Tailwind**, and **esbuild**. Add baseline dev tooling (Ruby + ERB formatting/linting, JS/TS lint/format) and **GitHub Actions** CI that runs on every **non-draft** PR.

> Every step must be **idempotent**, **documented**, and **safe to re-run**. Before executing each item, **look up the latest upstream docs / best practices** via the reference links or a quick web search.

---

## Specialisation

Act as a **Senior Dev Tooling Engineer**. Use official installers and maintained presets. Keep defaults conventional. Document non-obvious choices under `/docs`, keep the README concise and actionable.

## Notes & Gotchas

### Edge Rails
- **Edge Rails moves fast** – verify generator flags and defaults before running
- Currently using Rails 8.2.0.alpha from GitHub main branch
- Bullet gem does not yet support Rails 8.2.0.alpha and is commented out

### ERB Formatting
- Prefer `erb_lint --autocorrect` for ERB formatting
- Prettier ERB plugins may lag upstream releases

### CI Strategy
- Keep CI serial/simple initially
- Shard or split later only if needed
- Non-draft PR check implemented to avoid running CI on draft PRs

### Database Setup
- PostgreSQL configured with DATABASE_URL support
- Multiple databases for cache, queue, and cable in production
- Test database uses standard PostgreSQL service in CI

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- ESLint uses flat config (new format)
- TypeScript configured with `noEmit: true` for type checking only
- esbuild handles the actual bundling

### Tailwind CSS
- Using Tailwind CSS v4 (latest)
- Configured with standalone CLI
- Warnings about rdoc-ref attributes are expected and can be ignored

---

## Implementation Summary

This setup provides a modern Rails edge development environment with:

- **Latest Rails features** from the main branch
- **Type-safe JavaScript** with TypeScript
- **Modern CSS** with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Fast builds** with esbuild
- **Reliable background jobs** with Solid Queue
- **Comprehensive linting** (Ruby, ERB, JavaScript, TypeScript)
- **Security scanning** (Brakeman, bundler-audit)
- **Automated testing** with RSpec
- **CI/CD pipeline** that runs on every non-draft PR

All tooling is configured to work together seamlessly, with idempotent setup scripts and comprehensive documentation.

- Add Playwright end-to-end tests
- Configure path-scoped Copilot instructions for specific directories
